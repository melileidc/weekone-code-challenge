code challenge
The code challenges entail Student Grade generator, Speed Detector and Net Salary Calculator.
1. Student Grade Generator

This program is designed to calculate the grade of a student based on their input marks. The user is prompted to input marks for a student, which should be between 0 and 100. The program then determines the grade according to the following criteria:

    A: Marks greater than 79
    B: Marks between 60 and 79
    C: Marks between 50 and 59
    D: Marks between 40 and 49
    E: Marks less than 40

2.Speed Detector

This program takes as input the speed of a car and determines the demerit points accumulated by the driver. The speed limit is set at 70.

    If the speed is less than 70, the program prints "Ok".
    For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), the driver receives one demerit point, and the program prints the total number of demerit points.
    If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the program prints "License suspended".

3. Net Salary Calculator
This program calculates an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. It takes into account various deductions such as PAYE (Tax), NHIF deductions, and NSSF deductions.
